### 1. Tasks
*The main reason of creating that project is necessity of 
one source about me and my professional experience. Should be useful 
as a resume and be documented, tested and open-source.
Should be hosted on aws ec2 and redirected with DNS.*

### 2. Information blocks

*Every single component is single-responsible and not linked 
with another* 
1. Personal information 
2. My stack and technical experience
3. My purposes and current goals
4. My open-source projects and demos

<hr>

### 3. Stack

* React
* TypeScript
* React-testing-library
* Docker

<hr>

### 4. Design specification

*Should be very simple and minimalist, can be made with style-libraries.
Colours must not be bright and nasty.*
